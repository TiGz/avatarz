Cartoons have been a core part of how we communicate visually for over a century. From silent-era slapstick to modern animated series, these stylized drawings capture emotion and action in ways that feel immediate and relatable.

The beauty of cartoons lies in their flexibility. They range from simple, crude sketches to highly detailed digital creations. A cartoon can be a few lines on paper or a fully rendered 3D environment. What matters is that the style serves the story and connects with the viewer.

Google’s latest image model, Nano Banana Pro, now stands as one of the best options for creating images. While many know it for realistic photos, it’s equally skilled at handling art and cartoons. Whether you want vintage rubber hose animation or modern flat design, this tool delivers solid results across all styles.
